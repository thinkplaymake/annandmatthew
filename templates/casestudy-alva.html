			<h2>
			  The Brief
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Alva Labs AB is a Stockholm based SaaS scale-up, providing psychometric tests based on the Big 5 Model of Personality.
			</p>
				
			<p>Working from a basis of validated, 
				peer-reviewed academic research, 
				the Big 5 comprises a better 
				way to screen early-stage job 
				applications.</p>
				
			<p>Knowing they needed to launch 
				content marketing to engage 
				potential customers, increase 
				retention and create thought 
				leaders to market their value 
				proposition</p>

			<h2>
			  The Friction
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Many of their leadership team have PhDs, or are licensed psychologists; they came to Alva 
				straight from academia; successful scientists evidence every point you want to make, do not 
				exaggerate and balance every claim. You are calm, measured and reasoned. This is not the 
				mindset that will help a start-up to solve the problems they see.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This mindset was seen in their existing style guidelines: they were strict, academic and terse. 
				No-one felt empowered to write.
			</p>
				
			<p>The team were all writing and working in a second language which, even for the most conversant expert, 
				can add an additional layer of self-doubt and hesitation.
			</p>
			<p>We needed to communicate the validity and superiority of the Alva Labs assessment over its non-scientific 
				peers, the Meyers Briggs & DISC, locate our writing confidence and share our ideas. Trash-talking 
				the competition was never going to be our strategy, and we needed to integrate warmth and wit, 
				and bring a new confidence to a team of superlative talent</p>

			<h2>
			  OUR APPROACH
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				The founders were wrapped up in too many versions of their story - none of which they felt were right. So we took a step back, and asked Claudia and Ulrika tell their own story in their own words. <br/><br/>
				
				We located the true problem they’re solving. We helped them rediscover their purpose, and turned that into a clear positioning for their business.<br/><br/>
				
				The result? <br/><br/>
				
				Ulrika and Claudia, beaming. Two founders saying “Yes, that’s us”.
